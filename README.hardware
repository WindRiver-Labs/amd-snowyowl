3.1.3 Unsupported Features
--------------------------

The following features are not supported or validated:
1) AMD Watchdog
2) S3 and S4
3) Onboard Audio
4) CPU Freq


3.1.4 Known Issues 
------------------ 
1) When IOMMU is enabled, the probe of the MMC card would fail with errors like
this:
        [ 5.445699] mmc0: ADMA error 
        [ 5.445746] mmc0: error -5 whilst initialising MMC card
You can workaround this issue by disabling the IOMMU with the "iommu=off"
kernel parameter.

2) dmesg show "ttyS0 - failed to request DMA" this should be hardware issue
   and won't impact the using of ttyS0 console.

3) dmesg show "ccp 0000:03:00.2: SEV: failed to INIT error 0x8004"
   this is hardware issue on some board.


3.1.5 Notes
------------
We have observed that the Ethernet PHY continually link up/down when two AMD
boards are connected directly. This issue only occur when using some specific
SFP modules, such as Finisar FTLX8574D3BCL. Please consider to change to
another kind of SFP modules if you also observe this issue.
